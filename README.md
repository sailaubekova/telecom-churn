## Unsupervised telecom churn
- Case:
The mobile operator Ken-Telecom wants to find out how many of its subscribers switched to its competitor Dala-Telecom. All transactions of the two operators' subscribers are logged in a single database _abon_profile.csv_, but Ken-Telecom does not know which of its clients switched to Dala-Telecom. Let's imagine the world where two main operators, Ken-Telecom and Dala-Telecom, compete in a duopoly. The entire client base of a mobile operator consists of all subscribers who have made any type of transaction with that operator. Subscribers use devices with only one slot for a SIM card. The task is to analyze the data and help Ken-Telecom identify which of its subscribers switched to Dala-Telecom
- Data: <br>
*ken_telecom.csv* – transaction data for all subscribers of the cellular operator Ken-Telecom <br>
*dala_telecom.csv* - transaction data for all subscribers of the mobile operator Dala-Telecom <br>
*abon_profile.csv* – counters based on the subscribers of two operators available in the database (by the ID field)
